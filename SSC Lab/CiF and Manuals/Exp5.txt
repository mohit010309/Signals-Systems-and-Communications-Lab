Assignment 
1)	Verify the convolution property of Fourier transform. Generate two rectangular pulse of width 10 units and find the convolution in time and frequency domain.
2)	Verify the time shifting property of Fourier transform. Generate a rectangular pulse X(t). Find X(t-5) and X(t+5) using the time shifting property.
3)	Verify the frequency shifting property of Fourier Transform using X(t) = cos(2*pi*15*t).
